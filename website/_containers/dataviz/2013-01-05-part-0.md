Initial setup for our Data Visualization Tutorial.


<div class="well">
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: Please be sure to work through the <a href="{{ get_url("/begin/setup-your-machine")}}">machine setup</a> before proceeding.
</div>


<div class="well">
<b>Need to cheat a bit?</b> The complete Data Viz scripts can be found in <a href="https://github.com/econchick/new-coder/tree/master/dataviz"><code>new-coder/dataviz</code></a>.
</div>

Change into the Data Viz project:

```bash
$ cd new-coder/dataviz
```


Make sure you’ve installed [virtualenvwrapper](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) and followed the steps from the [machine setup]({{ get_url("/begin/setup-your-machine")}}) to set up your terminal correctly.
.
To make a virtual environment specific to your Data Viz project, run the following command. You should see `(DataVizProj)` before your prompt.

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv DataVizProj
(DataVizProj)$
```
* Now we will install the package requirements for this project. Your virtual environment will store the required packages in a self-contained area to not mess up with other Python projects.

```bash
(DataVizProj) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<div class="well">
<b>NOTE</b>: Sometimes, NumPy is finicky. If the previous step returns errors, try the following:
<pre><code>
(DataVizProj)$ pip install numpy
(DataVizProj)$ pip install matplotlib
(DataVizProj)$ pip install geojson
</code></pre>
</div>

## Finicky matplotlib doesn't install?

Sometimes, `matplotlib` is finicky as well. If you are on a Mac or Linux, and `pip install matplotlib` did not work, you are probably missing the supporting packages `zlib`, `freetype2` and `libpng`. Windows users do not need to worry about this as these packages are already included in the standard matplotlib Windows installers.

Before attempting to follow the instructions to compile these dependencies from source please use your package manager or its associated online package index to search for and install these dependencies instead. There usually exist pre-built packages for all these components on most [Linux](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/linux-package-management/) and BSD flavours as well as through macOS package managers [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org).

To install from source (order of installation is important here):

### ZLIB

1. Go to [zlib’s site](http://www.zlib.net/) and download the latest source code archive.
2. Scroll down to zlib source code, and download the latest current release in `tar.gz` format
3. Unpack the downloaded file by double-clicking to open it up.
4. Open your terminal, and type as follows:

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads  # or whichever directory the downloaded file was saved into
$ cd zlib-x.y.z  # whatever the version is you downloaded
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### LIBPNG

1. Navigate to the [libpng site](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).
2. Scroll down and download the latest version of `libpng`  by clicking the `tar.gz` link on the `Source Code` row.
3. Unpack the `tar.gz` file by double-clicking to open it up.
4. Open your terminal, and type as follows:

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads  # or whichever directory the downloaded file was saved into
$ cd libpng-x.y.z  # whatever the version is you downloaded
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

### FREETYPE

1. Navigate to [freetype’s sourcforge page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/latest/download?source=files). The download of the source file should shart automatically.
2. Unpack the file by double-clicking to open.
3. Open your terminal, and type as follows:

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads  # or whichever directory the downloaded file was saved into
$ cd freetype-x.y.z  # whatever the version is you downloaded
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

After installing these three packages, try typing `pip install matplotlib` in your *activated* virtualenv, `(DataVizProj)` and it should work.


* Test the installation real quick by starting up the Python interpreter:

```python
(DataVizProj)$ python
>>> import numpy
>>> import matplotlib
>>> import geojson
```
* If you have no errors (you would just see the `>>>` prompt), then you’re good to go. You can close out of the Python interpreter by pressing `CTRL+D`. If you do have errors, I’d try downloading [numpy](http://scipy.org/Download) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html) manually.
