Plot our sample data on a map with GeoJSON.

### Module Setup

Looking at `map.py` from [`new-coder/dataviz/tutorial_source/map.py`](https://github.com/econchick/new-coder/blob/master/dataviz/tutorial_source/map.py), you’ll see in lines after the preamble that we’re importing `geojson` which is a third-party package used to build [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/), a derivative of JSON files, as well as our own module, `parse` as `p`.

Other ways you could have done the import statements:

```python
from geojson import dumps
import geojson as g

import parse
from parse import parse, MY_FILE
import parse as iLoveParsingSoMuch
```

Of course, we're lazy programmers, so we’re not going to `import parse as iLoveParsingSoMuch` because each time we want to refer to our `parse()` function in the `parse` module, we’d have to type out `iLoveParsingSoMuch.parse(iLoveParsingSoMuch.MY_FILE, ",")` — you can probably see why I elected `p`.

We also don’t have to import the whole `geojson` library. Ideally, we want to run lean code, so only import the specific module that you need, or even objects (classes, functions, variables, etc) defined from within that module.

### Create a Map!

Now on to the good stuff.  The function `create_map(data_file)` parses through our data file to create a GeoJSON file.

Again with our initial comment setup:

```python
def create_map(data_file):
    # Define type of GeoJSON we're creating

    # Define empty list to collect each point to graph

    # Iterate over our data to create GeoJSON document.
    # We're using enumerate() so we get the line, as well
    # the index, which is the line number.

        # Skip any zero coordinates as this will throw off
        # our map.

        # Setup a new dictionary for each iteration.

        # Assign line items to appropriate GeoJSON fields.

        # Add data dictionary to our item_list

    # For each point in our item_list, we add the point to our
    # dictionary.  setdefault creates a key called 'features' that
    # has a value type of an empty list.  With each iteration, we
    # are appending our point to that list.

    # Now that all data is parsed in GeoJSON write to a file so we
    # can upload it to gist.github.com
```

The first that we need to do is just define the GeoJSON map type.  We’re defining the type of GeoJSON as a “FeatureCollection”, since it is a collection of features (features can be points, multi-points, linestring, etc.  More information [here](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)):

```python
    # Define type of GeoJSON we're creating
    geo_map = {"type": "FeatureCollection"}
```

Next, we just want to define an empty list to collect our coordinates/points when iterating over our CSV file:

```python
    # Define empty list to collect each point to graph
    item_list = []
```

Next, we iterate through the parsed data (`data_file`) that we fed the `create_map(data_file)` and make sure we build a temporary dictionary of data, `data` so we can add to our empty list, `item_list`, defined above:

```python
    # Iterate over our data to create GeoJSOn document.
    # We're using enumerate() so we get the line, as well
    # the index, which is the line number.
    for index, line in enumerate(data_file):

        # Skip any zero coordinates as this will throw off
        # our map.
        if line['X'] == "0" or line['Y'] == "0":
            continue

        # Setup a new dictionary for each iteration.
        data = {}

        # Assigne line items to appropriate GeoJSON fields.
        data['type'] = 'Feature'
        data['id'] = index
        data['properties'] = {'title': line['Category'],
                              'description': line['Descript'],
                              'date': line['Date']}
        data['geometry'] = {'type': 'Point',
                            'coordinates': (line['X'], line['Y'])}

        # Add data dictionary to our item_list
        item_list.append(data)

```

So for each line in our `data_file`, we take certain values of that line, `X`, `Y`, `Category`, etc, and assign it to a key that GeoJSON requires (e.g. `'type'`, `'id'`, `'properties'`, etc).  If, for whatever instance, longitude (`line['X']`) or latitude (`line['Y']`) is `0`, we'll skip over it.  The assumption is if the longitude or latitude is `0`, then we can't plot it (or it will be plotted as `0,0` and screw with our map). This is a simple form of skipping over errors in the data.

When we are done with one line, we add it to `item_list`, then continue with the next line item.

Notice that we are using `enumerate(data_file)`.  The `enumerate` built-in function allows us to go over each item in the datafile, `line`, and keep count of the line number with `index`.  So with each iteration of our for-loop, the index will increase by 1 as we go onto the next line.

Next, we actually build onto our `geo_map` dictionary by adding our points from `item_list`:


```python
    # For each point in our item_list, we add the point to our
    # dictionary.  setdefault creates a key called 'features' that
    # has a value type of an empty list.  With each iteration, we
    # are appending our point to that list.
    for point in item_list:
        geo_map.setdefault('features', []).append(point)
```

As it says in the comments, for each point in `item_list`, we append the point to our `geo_map` dictionary.  Here, we’re using the `setdefault` method on our dictionary.  This sets a key to `features` and its value to an empty list.  And so with each iteration over `item_list`, we append the point to the list.  You can read more information about setdefault [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/dictionary_setdefault.htm).

So we’ve built up our `geo_map` dictionary to contain every point in our datafile.  Now let’s save it as a geojson file:

```python
    # Now that all data is parsed in GeoJSON write to a file so we
    # can upload it to gist.github.com
    with open('file_sf.geojson', 'w') as f:
        f.write(geojson.dumps(geo_map))
```

This is a new loop construct: `with` — it allows us to not have to worry about closing a file; it will be done automatically for us.  More about the `with` built-in can be read [here](http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example).

So `with open('file_sf.geojson', 'w') as f` assigns the opened file as f; it also will either open the file `file_sf.geojson` or create it (**note**: it will be in your current directory unless you specify otherwise, like `/Users/lynnroot/NotMyDevFolder/file_sf.geojson` with absolute file paths), and give it `write` capabilities (versus read-only).

Then we use the `dumps` function from the `geojson` library that we imported.  This basically prints the dictionary, `geo_map` into a GeoJSON-recognizable file.

Let’s see the `create_map()` function all together:

```python
def create_map(data_file):
    """Creates a GeoJSON file.

    Returns a GeoJSON file that can be rendered in a GitHub
    Gist at gist.github.com.  Just copy the output file and
    paste into a new Gist, then create either a public or
    private gist.  GitHub will automatically render the GeoJSON
    file as a map.
    """

    # Define type of GeoJSON we're creating
    geo_map = {"type": "FeatureCollection"}

    # Define empty list to collect each point to graph
    item_list = []

    # Iterate over our data to create GeoJSOn document.
    # We're using enumerate() so we get the line, as well
    # the index, which is the line number.
    for index, line in enumerate(data_file):

        # Skip any zero coordinates as this will throw off
        # our map.
        if line['X'] == "0" or line['Y'] == "0":
            continue

        # Setup a new dictionary for each iteration.
        data = {}

        # Assigne line items to appropriate GeoJSON fields.
        data['type'] = 'Feature'
        data['id'] = index
        data['properties'] = {'title': line['Category'],
                              'description': line['Descript'],
                              'date': line['Date']}
        data['geometry'] = {'type': 'Point',
                            'coordinates': (line['X'], line['Y'])}

        # Add data dictionary to our item_list
        item_list.append(data)

    # For each point in our item_list, we add the point to our
    # dictionary.  setdefault creates a key called 'features' that
    # has a value type of an empty list.  With each iteration, we
    # are appending our point to that list.
    for point in item_list:
        geo_map.setdefault('features', []).append(point)

    # Now that all data is parsed in GeoJSON write to a file so we
    # can upload it to gist.github.com
    with open('file_sf.geojson', 'w') as f:
        f.write(geojson.dumps(geo_map))
```

That’s it! Now we just have some boiler code for that `main()` function:

```python
def main():
    data = p.parse(p.MY_FILE, ",")

    return create_map(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here we just first parse our data, then return the GeoJSON document using that parsed data.

Next, save this file as `map.py` into the `MySourceFiles` directory that we created earlier, and make sure you are in that directory in your terminal by using `cd` and `pwd` to navigate as we did before. Also — make sure your virtualenv is active. Now, in your terminal, run:

```bash
(DataVizProj) $ python map.py
(DataVizProj) $ ls
```

You should see `file_sf.geojson` file now! You can open it up in your text editor; a snipit should look like this:


    {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": ["-122.424612993055", "37.8014488257836"]}, "type": "Feature", "id": 0, "properties": {"date": "02/18/2003", "description": "FORGERY, CREDIT CARD", "title": "FRAUD"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": ["-122.420120319211", "37.7877570602182"]}, "type": "Feature", "id": 1, "properties": {"date": "04/17/2003", "description": "WARRANT ARREST", "title": "WARRANTS"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": ["-122.42025048261", "37.7800745746105"]},


To see it up on Github, navigate to [gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com/), then copy the text in the newly-created geojson file, and paste into the Gist, like below:

Make sure to name your gist file with the `.geojson` ending:

Then select either “Create Secret Gist” or “Create Public Gist”, your choice:

And voila!

If you click on a point, you should see more information about the item.  This is pulled from the `data['properties']` value that we created:
