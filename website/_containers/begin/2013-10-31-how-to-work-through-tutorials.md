How should a new coder approach these tutorials?

### Tech Requirements

If at any time you have issues installing anything, don't hesitate to [contact me]( {{ get_url('contact/')}}).

* [Python 2.x](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/)
	* Mac OS X and Linux often ship with Python installed. To check, open up a terminal, type `python --version`, and if you get an error message, or if your version is older than 2.7, go ahead and [install or update](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/).
	* Windows does not automatically come with Python installed, and must be downloaded from the [website](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/).
* A text editor.  Some options include:
	* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) for Mac, Linux, or Windows
	* [Atom](https://atom.io/) for Mac, Linux or Windows
	* [gEdit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) for Linux
	* [NotePad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows
	* [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) for Mac
* [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
* Optional but suggested: a [GitHub](http://github.com) or [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) account to upload, display, and share your code.

### Knowledge Requirements

* Have worked through something like [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/), [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) or others that teach syntax. No need to complete any/all of these introductory resources, but the tutorials will _not_ walk you through the basics of Python syntax.
* Want to continue to learn Python and/or learn to code.

Haven't worked through any of the above resources? It's okay – feel free to do these tutorials as well, but have patience for yourself and don’t be shy on using Google or referring to those resources for syntax help.

### Purpose of these tutorials

Each tutorial is meant to be worked through in the order presented, but can be skipped if not challenging enough:

* Data Visualization
* APIs
* Web Scraping
* Networks
* GUI

Each tutorial can stand on its own, but gently advances in development topics that a new coder may not be exposed to when trying to learn on his/her own.  It‘s okay to get bored, frustrated, distracted, etc. Life happens. The tutorials will still be here for when you return – just be sure to [save your progress]( {{ get_url('begin/save-your-progress') }}).

Code for these tutorials may not be the most Pythonic — it’s meant to teach.
