Putting all the pieces together to scrape our data.

## scrapy.cfg file

Scrapy needs a configuration file to direct it to where our project lies. The config file needs to be in the project root directory. An example of our directory structure for our application:

```
.
├── my_scraper
│   ├── scraper_app
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── items.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── pipelines.py
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   └── spiders
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── livingsocial_spider.py
│   └── scrapy.cfg  # we must create this file now
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Create a file called `scrapy.cfg` within `/my_scraper/` directory. This file should contain the name of the python module that defines the project settings:

```
[settings]
default = scraper_app.settings
```

## Manually run the scraper

Within your terminal, with your ScrapeProj virtualenv activated:

```bash
(ScrapeProj) $ cd my_scraper/scraper_app
(ScrapeProj) $ scrapy crawl livingsocial
```

Where `livingsocial` is the `BOT_NAME` defined in `settings.py`.

Next, to see the data that's saved into the database, start up Postgres and enter these commands:

```psql
$ psql -h localhost
psql (9.1.4, server 9.1.3)
Type "help" for help.

lynnroot=# \connect scrape
psql (9.1.4, server 9.1.3)
You are now connected to database "scrape" as user "lynnroot".
scrape=# select * from deals limit 5;
 id |                       title                       |                                               link                                               |     location      | original_price | price |      end_date

(5 rows)
```

Try a few of these select queries:

```psql
scrape=# select title from deals limit 30;
scrape=# select link from deals where price < '50';
scrape=# select title from deals where end_date < '2015-02-08';
scrape=# select * from deals where title like ('%Yoga');
```

Notice how the strings we’re searching for contains `%` – this is a wildcard character. This is essentially saying “find deals where the title contains “Yoga”. Learn more about [querying Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/tutorial-select.html).


### Hook up to a Cron job

It’d be pretty annoying if we had to manually run this script regularly.  This is where cron jobs come in.

We’ll first create a bash script that simulates what we would do if we were to run scrapy manually.  There is a sample one in the `new-coder/scrape/living_social/` directory called `scrape.sh`. Edit the bash script to where your `(ScrapeProj)` virtualenv is as well as where your scraper root directory is (where the `scrapy.cfg` file lies).

Next, within your terminal, type:

```bash
$ crontab -e
```
to edit your crontab file.  This opens up the editor for your cron tab.  Add a line:

`0 13  * * * sh ~/Projects/new-coder/scrape/living_social/scrapy.sh`

This says that ever day at hour 13 (1pm, relative to your local machine time), run the `scrapy.sh` script.  To schedule your cron job at a different time, check out Wiki's [overview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Predefined_scheduling_definitions).

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">NOTE</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
<p>The cron job will run automatically for whenever you schedule it to run (in this example, daily at 1pm).</p>
<p>But! It will only run when your computer is on (not hibernate/sleep or powered off), and in particular with this script, connected to the internet.</p>
<p>To run the cron job regardless of the state your computer is in, you would host the scraper code + the bash script and cron job on a separate server (either your own, or a company's) that will always be 'on'.  You can host your own cron jobs on <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a>.</p>
