Examples of APIs being used in real life, and where to go from here.


## In action

* Applications & clients for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, etc all interact with the respective API built for developers.
* [Lyft](http://lyft.me) uses [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/10/lyft-and-twilio.html) to send SMS messages to let passengers know their ride is on its way and to communicate with drivers.
* [Trulia](http://corp.truliablog.com/2008/10/10/social-media-synergy-trulia-integrates-yelp-reviews-into-google-maps/), [Yellow Pages](http://cbsyellowpages.com/), and [GrubHub](http://www.grubhub.com) all use [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/examples)’s API for integrating reviews into their websites.

## Where to go from here

* Combine your recently acquired data visualization knowledge to visualize your [Twitter](http://api.twitter.com) followers and friends using [python-twitter](https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) to connect to the API and [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.com) to visualize your relationship.
* Try creating a virtual vacation by collecting photos via APIs from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) or [500px](http://developers.500px.com/).
* [Great list of popular APIs](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/25/a-look-at-the-uptime-of-50-popular-apis/) to satisfy your own creative needs.
