    	<h1>About the Project</h1>
    	<article>
    		<p>Learning something new is difficult; it takes guts. Folks come in with a lot of energy and eagerness, only to experience discouragement when there aren't a lot of resources to step beyond the 'learn syntax' to programming. Often there are questions of, "Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?" How do you answer that?</p>
    		<p>Many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. You direct them to Learn Python the Hard Way, Codecademy, or Dive into Python. Great! But now what?</p>
    		<p>I've built 5 digestible projects to gradually progress the Python learner from near drowning to a decent swimmer. The goal is to have new coders feeling accomplished and to continuing learning.</p>
