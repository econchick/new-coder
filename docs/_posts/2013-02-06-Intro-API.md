Video games have always been a pricy hobby. With the next generation of consoles just being announced (or about to be) it makes sense to look at how pricing has changed on that front over time.

During the course of this tutorial you will get more familiar with some non-core Python libraries: [requests][requests] for making interactions with HTTP much more easier, [matplotlib][matplotlib] for generating graphs and charts of various kinds and [tablib][tablib] for easily generating CSV datasets.

### Project

To this end we will write a simple script that fetches video game platform information from [Giantbomb.com][gb], combine that with CPI information made available by the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis][fred] ([http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/CPIAUCSL.txt](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/CPIAUCSL.txt)) to adapt the value of the US dollar over time (this calculation is not meant to be accurate but it provides a nice example of working with diverse datasets) and generate a bar  chart and a CSV file displaying the price development.

### General advice

Especially when working with multiple components and libraries, try to divide your problem-space into as many small chunks as possible. For scripts like this I usually at first write a small main-function that contains tons of calls to other (not-yet-existing) functions and methods that match what the script's supposed to do on a very high level.

When working with APIs that might easily change in the future and you don't necessarily get notified about (like a classic web API that doesn't provide multiple versions of itself to allow for backwards-compatibility) it is generally a good idea to wrap the provided functionality. This way if something changes, you only have to change your own API wrapper but not the code that uses it.
