"""
Data Visualization Project

Parse data from an ugly CSV or Excel file, and render it in
JSON-like form, visualize in graphs, and plot as a map.

Part III: Take the data we parsed earlier and create a different format
for rendering a map. Here, we parse through each line item of the
CSV file and create a geojson object, to be collected into one geojson
file for uploading to gist.github.com.
